## Immediate Security Checklist

### Phase 1A: Basic Security (Week 4-5)
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Move all secrets to environment variables
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Add Pydantic validators for all API inputs  
- [ ] **SQL Injection**: Ensure all queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] **File Upload Security**: Validate file types, sizes, scan for malware
- [ ] **HTTPS Enforcement**: Force HTTPS in production environment
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Implement CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options

### Phase 1B: Authentication (Week 6-7)  
- [ ] **User Registration**: Email verification workflow
- [ ] **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing, complexity requirements
- [ ] **Session Management**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- [ ] **Two-Factor Auth**: TOTP or SMS-based 2FA
- [ ] **Account Lockout**: Brute force protection
- [ ] **Password Reset**: Secure reset workflow with time-limited tokens

## Infrastructure Setup Priority

### Cloud Provider Selection
**Recommended: AWS** (due to mature Australian presence)
- Sydney region (ap-southeast-2) for data residency
- EKS for Kubernetes, RDS for PostgreSQL
- S3 for document storage, CloudFront for CDN
- KMS for encryption key management

**Alternative: Microsoft Azure**
- Australia East region for data residency  
- AKS for Kubernetes, Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- Blob Storage, Azure CDN
- Key Vault for secrets management

### Monitoring Setup (Week 8)
```bash
# Application Monitoring
- Sentry for error tracking
- New Relic or Datadog for APM
- CloudWatch/Azure Monitor for infrastructure

# Logging
- Structured JSON logging with python-json-logger
- Centralized logging with ELK stack or cloud equivalent
- Log retention policies (7 years for tax records)
```

## Compliance Preparation

### Privacy Act 1988 Requirements (Start Week 9)
- [ ] **Privacy Policy**: Draft comprehensive privacy policy
- [ ] **Consent Management**: Implement granular consent mechanisms
